----------
This directory contains the files for the LED rings:
- V0.1: first version of the 'square' PCB with the LED ring. Inside there is a breakout part for WS2812 LEDs (but footprints are not correct)
- V0.2: same as V0.1, but again reduced PCB size a bit to assemble them easier. Moved connectors more to the inside to have more space.
- V1.0: first version of the 'round' version
- V1.1: same as V1.0, but outer cutout slighlty smaller to have some tolerance when assembling the boards
