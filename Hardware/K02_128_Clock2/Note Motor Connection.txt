Note:
Up and including K02 V1.5 the order of motor connections for the external motor on J8 and J10 is not correct:
The order of pins is A1, A2, A4, A3 (should be A1, A2, A3, A4), samd for Bx.
With this, the pins in the cable for A3 and A4 (resp. B3 and B4) need to be swapped, otherwise the external motor makes more noise than necessary.
A future revision of the board should correct this.
