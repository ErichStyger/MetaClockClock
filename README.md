# MetaClockClock
Project to build a clock with clocks: the Meta Clock Clock!
The idea is to use many 'clocks' to display information, including showing the time. The design is very modular, and it can be customized in many ways:
- number of clocks, There are builds with 24, 60 or even 120 clocks
- with or without RGB LEDs
